* **Location**: 105 Stuart Hall

## Course description

This course surveys mathematical and statistical tools that are foundational to computational social science. Topics to be reviewed include mathematical notation and linear equations, calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, and statistical inference. Students are assumed to have encountered most of these topics previously, so that the camp serves as a refresher rather than teaching entirely new topics. Class sessions will emphasize problem solving and in-class exercises applying these techniques. Students who successfully complete the camp are situated to pass the MACSS math and statistics placement exam and enroll in computationally-enhanced course offerings at the University of Chicago without prior introductory coursework.

## Who should take this course

* Students in the [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/)
    * Computational economists seeking to enroll in PhD courses in the Department of Economics in their first year should instead enroll in the Economics Doctoral Math Camp
    * All other incoming Computation students are expected to enroll in this math camp
* MA and PhD students in the social sciences who have significant prior training and experience in mathematics and statistics and seek to complete the [Certificate in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/content/certificate-current-students)
* Students looking for a slower-paced camp focused specifically on algebra, calculus, and probability should enroll in SOSC 30100 - Mathematics for Social Sciences. This two-week course runs from September 9-20 and makes no assumption of prior math/stats training. Those of you who struggle with the material of this course may switch after the first week to SOSC 30100.

## Grades

This course may only be taken for pass/fail (non-credit), not for a letter grade or audit. Assignments are comprised of daily problem sets which you will work on in class. You are encouraged to work in groups, and the instructional staff is available for consultation during class hours. We expect most students should be able to finish the problem sets during class hours. Grades will be based upon performance on the problem sets.

## Disability services

If you need any special accommodations, please provide us with a copy of your Accommodation Determination Letter (provided to you by the Student Disability Services office) as soon as possible so that you may discuss with me how your accommodations may be implemented in this course.
